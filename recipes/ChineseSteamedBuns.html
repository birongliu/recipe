        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Mix together 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup warm water, yeast, and 1
            teaspoon sugar in a large bowl. Allow to sit for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, remaining 1/2 cup warm water, 2
            tablespoons sugar, vegetable oil, and salt. Knead until dough is
            smooth and elastic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a greased bowl, roll to coat with oil, and let sit until
            tripled in size, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Punch down dough and spread out on a floured board. Sprinkle baking
            powder evenly on surface of dough; knead for 5 minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide dough in half; set aside one half in a covered bowl. Divide
            remaining half into 12 equal pieces
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape each into a ball; transfer each ball to a small square of
            waxed paper with the smooth surface facing up. Repeat portioning and
            shaping with remaining dough half. Cover all 24 dough balls and let
            sit until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring some water to a boil in a wok, then reduce heat to medium and
            keep water at a low boil. Place the steam plate on a small wire rack
            in the middle of the wok, leaving at least 2 inches of space between
            the plate and the wok. Working in batches, place buns on waxed paper
            squares onto the steam plate, leaving 1 to 2 inches between buns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and steam buns for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the lid, so
            condensation doesn't drip onto buns. Continue steaming remaining
            buns until all are cooked
